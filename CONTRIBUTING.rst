Everyone is encouraged to contribute!

If you can provide a change as a pull request, please do so. If not, please open an issue `here
<https://github.com/mborsetti/airportdata/issues>`__ and someone will look into it.

Please provide as many links to primary sources (e.g. ICAO, national aviation authority, IATA, etc.) as you can to
help out in the verification process. ARINC data (e.g. from https://skyvector.com/) is a good source as well.

P.S. Python contributors can test changes locally with ``tox`` or:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -U airportsdata[testing]
  pytest tests/ -v


Thanks to the following for already contributing:
