FAA/TC LIDs
============

Many airports overseen by the U.S. FAA and Transport Canada lack an ICAO identifier, but are assigned a Location
Identifier ('FAA/TC LID') by the relevant entity. These airports are included in this database, and have been assigned
an identifier as follows:

* If the airport has a 4-digit FAA/TC LID, the LID is used. These identifiers are distinguishable from ICAO ones as
  they contain at least one character that is a number, while ICAO identifiers are all letters.
* If the airport has a 3-digit FAA/TC LID, a 4-digit pseudo-ICAO identifier is generated by prefacing the LID with
  '``K``'.  These identifiers are not distinguishable from ICAO ones also starting with '``K``'.
