* Fixed regression in 20230905 where Python installation would not include the data files.

**Notice**

Support for Python 3.8 will be removed on or about 5 October 2023. Older Python versions are supported for 3 years
after being obsoleted by a new major release (i.e. about 4 years since their original release). This will not affect
the CSV file.
