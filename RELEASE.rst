Version 20210608.2
==================
* Added VVVD/Van Don International Airport
* Fixed elevation being saved as float (with '.0' decimal) instead of integer; file is smaller as a result, with no
  change in precision
* Removed non-breaking spaces found in names of 4 airports
* Internal: implemented the `pathlib <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html>`__ library
