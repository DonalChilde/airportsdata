* Added _OUK/OUK, Out Skerries Airstrip, Shetland, Scotland, Great Britain, LID: EG78. This is a landing strip
  which has an IATA location identifier but no ICAO one, and is not present in GB'S AIP. As such, a pseudo-IATA location
  identifier of ``_OUK`` is used in this database. This airstrip is often identified as ``EG78`` (which is not an
  ICAO location identifier) and this value is used as a pseudo-LID. Based on the upstream PR `#89
